# Cracking Codes with Python

## What is it?
A work through of the book Cracking Codes with Python

## I read the book, this isn't the example code from it
Yeah, writing a bunch of singular app files wasn't how I wanted to do it. So I went a slightly more OOP route.

## How can I help?
:shrug: I mean, it is a walkthrough of a book. I don't think there is much to do after the book is done. Although I may
go through and create a different release with a bit more of a proper setup for fun.
